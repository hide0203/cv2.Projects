# cv2.Projects
A record of my journey as I learn cv2 and make projects on it.
Since I'm learning from ChatGPT, there may be similarities in my code.

```pip install opencv-python```  
Command to install cv2

```pip install mediapipe```
commands to install mediapipe

so far it only needs cv2 and mediapipe. (WIP)
